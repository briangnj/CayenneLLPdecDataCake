# CayenneLLPdecDataCake
This is a version of the [ElectronicCats/CayenneLLP][ElectronicCats-link] [TTN][TTN-link]  decoder modified to work with [Datacake][Datacake-link]. 

This script has been tested with a LORA payload using the myDevicesIoT/CayenneLLP encoder.

Formatting changes were made based on this Datacake Specifications Doc.
