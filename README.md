# CayenneLLPdecDataCake
This is a version of the [ElectronicCats/CayenneLLP][ElectonicCats-link] TTN  decoder modified to work with Datacake. 

This script has been tested with a LORA payload using the myDevicesIoT/CayenneLLP encoder.

Formatting changes were made based on this Datacake Specifications Doc.
