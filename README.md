# CayenneLLPdecDatacake
This is a version of the [ElectronicCats/CayenneLLP][ElectronicCats-link] [TTN][TTN-link]  decoder modified to work with [Datacake][Datacake-link]. 

This script has been tested with a LORA payload using the [myDevicesIoT/CayenneLLP][myDevicesIoT-link] encoder.

Formatting changes were made based on this [Datacake Specifications Doc][Datacake-spec-link].
